# CrowdFundLite

A minimal time-bound crowdfunding smart contract built in Solidity.

CrowdFundLite allows a project owner to raise funds within a fixed duration. If the funding goal is reached before the deadline, the owner can withdraw the funds. If the goal is not met, contributors can claim refunds.

This project demonstrates core Solidity concepts such as enums (state machine design), mappings, dynamic arrays, payable functions, time-based logic using `block.timestamp`, access control, and secure ETH handling using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.
